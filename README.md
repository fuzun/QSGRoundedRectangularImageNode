# QSGRoundedRectangularImageNode
Qt Scene Graph Rounded Rectangular Image Node

This class provides a rectangular image node for the Qt Scene Graph.

Basically, this is a `QSGImageNode` with a `radius` feature. It works
on the basis of simplified `QPainterPath` being compatible with
GPU drawing primitives.
